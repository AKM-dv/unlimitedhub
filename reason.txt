Dear Partner,

Greetings. Below is the requested clarification for the Unlimited Hub project submission:

1. Payment gateway use case  
   - Purpose: enable prepaid recharges (voice minutes and diamonds) and top-ups for the in-app shopping module.  
   - Flow: the gateway collects INR payments, maps them to a user’s recharge order, and credits the appropriate in-app wallets after a successful transaction. No external merchant settlements occur beyond this recharge workflow.

2. Wallet classification  
   - Type: closed wallet.  
   - Rationale: users can spend the credited value only inside Unlimited Hub (voice minutes wallet, diamonds wallet, and earnings wallet). Balances are non-transferable, non-withdrawable, and limited to platform services and merchandise.

3. Current product status  
   - Web landing page (`index.html`) is presently a static marketing shell and does not yet host the functional web client.  
   - Native app build is in pre-release; backend hooks for calls, wallet accounting, and commerce are still under integration, so no public stores listing exists yet.  
   - Action: development team is wiring real data sources into the existing frontend and scheduling the first internal beta to unlock live functionality.

4. Required updates & next steps  
   - Ship MVP interactions on the website (authentication handoff and wallet snapshot placeholders).  
   - Complete end-to-end QA on the Android build, then push to closed testing.  
   - Once the payment module passes certification, capture and share an on-device screen recording that covers login, recharge, and payment gateway confirmation. We will provide this recording together with admin-panel proof once the build is stable.

Thank you for your review. Please let us know if you require any additional compliance artifacts or specific recording guidelines.

Regards,  
Unlimited Hub Team
